Rough answers to questions:

1. The observational units are individual movies. Quantitative variables include budget, popularity, revenue, runtime, vote average and vote count. Categorical variables include genres, keywords, original language, production company, production country and release date.
2. skim / summarize data /make a table here
3. a couple of graphs (might be interesting to do PCA/cluster data)
